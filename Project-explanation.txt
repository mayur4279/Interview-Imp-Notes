## Project Explanation:  
------------
Description:   
------------
  - The project i worked on is a ecommers website in which user can purchase the products.    
  - We have 14 members of of teams where we have 3 frontend developers, 3 backend developers, 2 full stack developers, 
  1 system administrator, 2 DevOps engineers && 1 project manager and 2 testers.    

-----------
Tech Stack: 
-----------
If i talk about Tech Stack, for frontend we used Angular js, For backend we use spring boot and for database we use postgressql. 
- Our Frontend is depolyed over s3 bucket where 1 is main frontend which is homepage and others are micro frontends. 
  total four frontends are there.  
- Our Backend is deployed over the eks cluster. i which we have approx 18 backends.  
- For connecting backend with frontend we expose our backend on subdomain (api.example.com), 
  and for connecting database to backend we use RDS Endpoints.   
- For handling the DNS request we use Route53.  
- & For improving the latency performence we use cloudfront.   

--------------------
Deployment Strategy: 
--------------------
When it come to Deployment Strategy, we have 4 four branches (dev, test, UAT, Production). 

- In Dev Branch The initial stage of developement is happen. All new feature are added here.  
- Once the code is stable, it's merged into test branch.   
- After passing the test branch, the code moves to UAT branch where 4-5 end user will test the application.  
- & the final live environment is managed through the production branches.   
 
Apart from that i also work with two other branches. (hotfix banch:- In we resole issue directly in production branch,
&  feature branch:- If we want to add new feature without affecting the main branch in this case we use this branch)   
  
--------------
DevOps tools: 
-------------- 
To somothen this process we use several devOps tools like,
- github for managing our project code with Multiple branches,   
- Docker for creating containerized application,   
- kubernetes for managing all containers,  
- Terraform for creating infra in the form of code,   
- & jenkins for continues Intigration and continues Deployment.      


----------
Pipeline: 
----------
If i Talk about the Pipeline we have 4 stage pipeline.  
 
- 1st stage is for pulling the code form version control tool like (github)    
- 2nd stage is for building the artifact using tools called maven.  
- 3rd stage is for checking the code quality using tool called sonarqube.  
- 4th stage is for deploying application.    

& if new commit happen pipeline get trigger automatically.
