what is computing ? cloud computing means renting services over the internet instead of running them on your own computer. 

why we use cloud  ?  
- cost saving (pay only what you use ) 
- easy scaling ( quickly scale you application)   
- access anywhere 
- Backup and Recovery 
- Better security 
- Gloabal Reach  (because we are deploying our application over multiple regions)  


Types of cloud ?  
public cloud: 
  - public cloud is owned and operated by third party cloud providers.  
  - They offer services to multiple customers & used by everyone.  
Private cloud: 
   - On premises servers (used for sensitive informations)   
Hybrid cloud: 
   - combination of both public and private cloud 
   - which means some of our infrastructure on public cloud and some are in private cloud such as databases.   
community cloud: 
   - community cloud are shared by different organisation with similar intrest or requirement.  
     


Cloud Services Models:  
On-site (on-premises): whenever we want to host the webste we have to manage everything.   
Iaas : (ec2) 
Paas : (aws beanstawlk )   
Saas: we don't have to manage anything we just need to create an account ans start using it. 
      gmail, slack, office 365

What is Regions ?  
- Aws services are either regional or global (regional --> ec2, vpc etc, global --> s3 )

how to choose right region ?  
- Data stayes in your region: complience with data governanace and local requirement)  
- Closer to cutomer for latency performence 
- Service Availability: Not all services or feature are available everywhere.  
  for example: new tool might launch in us first and come to other regions later  
- Cost difference: Price can vary by region 

What is Availablity zones (min-2, max-6, but usually-3)    
- An Availability zones are the separate data centers woth its own power network.   
- They are connected each other with own Aws networking wich is high speed and low latency. 
1-subnet --> 1AZ  


Edge locations: They are used by aws to deliver content to user faster.  
- caching the data 
- used with s3 and cloudformations  
- Edge location is a part of Aws's global content delivery network (CDN) called Amazon CloudFront.
