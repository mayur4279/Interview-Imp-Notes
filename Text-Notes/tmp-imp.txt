sometimes the code is run in Developers end but its not run in  Operational end 
to overcome this issue we use devOps methodology...   
the main goal of DevOps is to bridge the gap between software developers and operational team...  

so most of the task and most of thw work is reduced...  

what are the challeges that you are faced while developing cicd pipeline ?  


the main challenge is with jenkins, there are lot of vidoes and and lot of blog related to the jenkins installation... 
It took me one day to solve that problems 


github webhook  ? 


That could be handled only by the administrator..   


Again its depend on project size if there is 70 to 80 services available then we use microservices based arcitecture..   
If product is not to big then we can go ahed with monolithic applucation.  



how to answer not ?  how many types of auto acaling ? Actually i not sure the types of auto scaling... lol  

application load balancer handles http & https traffic..  



If you are going for cloud engineering you need to deal with multiple project but if you are going for devOps interview you only work with one project
