AWS STS: 

Aws security token service (STS) is  a global service which we cannot access graphically we only access using programatically...  

which provide us the temporay credentials..   





Management account  --> user is created and attached inline policy (STS)  

Testing account (test related workload are deployed)  ---> Role is created for management account...   



managed policies: can be attached to multiple users groups and roles..
                 (does not depend on the user group or the roles means if delete any one of them it cannot be affected)  

inline policy: Directly attached to the single role, group or the user... if delete any one of them it will  get deleted.
               it follows one to one relationship... it can be attach only one at the time... its specific to this user only...
