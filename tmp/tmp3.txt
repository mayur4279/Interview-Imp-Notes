

step 1) Create RDS (because we need to add endpoint in spring backend)   

step 2) Create artifact using maven  
        deploy this artifact in lightweight container  

step 3) Create frontend with nodejs  
        deploy artifact in lightweight container...    
        run with ng command....   

step 4) deploy over kubernetes  
        write Deployment file for deploying pods (frontend and backend)  
        write services file for services (frontend and backend) 
        deploy over kubernetes...
