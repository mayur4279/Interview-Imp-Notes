## Project Explanation:  
------------
Description:   
------------
  - The project i worked on is a ecommers website in which user can purchase the products and gifts.    
  - We have 14 members of of teams where we have 3 frontend developers, 3 backend developers, 2 full stack developers, 
  1 system administrator, 2 DevOps engineers && 1 project manager and 2 testers.    

-----------
Tech Stack: 
-----------
If i talk about Tech Stack, for frontend we used Angular js, For backend we use spring boot and for database we use mysql. 
- Our Frontend is depolyed over s3 bucket where 1 is main frontend which is homepage and others are micro frontends. 
  total four frontends are there.  
- Our Backend is deployed over the eks cluster. in which we have approx 18 backends.  
- Our Database is deployed over Aws RDS service.   
- For connecting backend with frontend we expose our backend on subdomain (api.example.com), 
  and for connecting database to backend we use RDS Endpoints.   
- For handling the DNS request we use Route53.  
- & For improving the latency performence we use cloudfront.   

--------------------
Deployment Strategy: 
--------------------
When it come to Deployment Strategy, we have 4 four branches (dev, test, UAT, Production). 

- In Dev all developers are working together with multiple feature branches.  
- After completing development the code is merged into Test branch where testers check the quality of the code.  
- If the code passed from Test branch then it will be moved into uat branch where 4 to 5 end users will test the application.  
- & from production branch the live environment is managed.    

Apart from that i also work with hotfix branch In which we resole issue directly in production branch.   

--------------
DevOps tools: 
-------------- 
To somothen this process we use several devOps tools like,
- github for managing our project code with Multiple branches,   
- Docker for creating containerized application,   
- kubernetes for managing all containers,  
- Terraform for creating infra in the form of code,   
- & jenkins for continues Intigration and continues Deployment.      


----------
Pipeline: 
----------
If i Talk about the Pipeline we have 4 stage pipeline.  
 
- 1st stage is for pulling the code form version control tool like (github)    
- 2nd stage is for building the artifact using tools called maven.  
- 3rd stage is for checking the code quality using tool called sonarqube.  
- 4th stage is for deploying application.

Tmp notes 
----------  

project explanation lecture..   

1. Aws there tier project 

domain  - erp,  ecommers, medical --->    koi bhi batado   

team size - 13   (backend-3, frontend-3, devops-1 system -1)  if intern project is still running  

dyl.com, igp.com      

please explain about your latest project  ??? 

backend is exposed on subdomain..   like  api.dyl.com  or api.inbestment.com  
frontend devepoled with react,  backend with angular , we have , cdn, route53  

deployment stargious:  
 
four branch :- Dev    ---------------------
                          \ if done 
               Test   ---------------------

               UAT    ---------------------

               prod  ----------------------   (live environment)  ex:amazon.com  


user acceptance Test (4-5 end user will test)  

hotfix banch:- we resole issue directly in production 
&  feature branch:- If we want to add new feature without affecting the main branch in this case we use this branch)   
  

my project ....  where invesetor ....  if i talk about tech stack  we use .... for frontent ... backend  ... backend is exposed over subdomain ...  database post gresssql 

aprrox 18 backend, 18 database , 

provide rediention to stakeholders and they 

to smootehn this process we are use several devops tols, such as for terraforn, aws, jenkins, docker , github  

pipeline 4 stage pull, build, test, Deploy  

if i talk about my resposibilities:-  project is started befor/after 1 year 

and resposibilities are... where i wrote docker file, terraform file, maintaining...  monitoring   

i was responsibile for writing couple of docker files ....  

apart from that we also worked with two other branch,  pipeline gets trigger automatically  




angular is more suitable for frontend ...
